      "Koinonia is a much loved and globally acclaimed ministry. It's a place well known for strong Bible based spirituality and uncompromising excellence in all spheres. Black or White, Caucasians and Asians alike, the messages from Koinonia cuts across all of humanity, bringing people who seek and are hungry for a more in-depth walk with The Creator, through Jesus. On a very regular basis, people embark on a pilgrimage to Koinonia, with the purpose of worshipping with others, at a very crowded yet very organized assembly. MetroHostels has done the work of partnering with accommodation sites in proximity to the venue. Pilgrims can focus on their purpose, whilst we focus on their proximity.",

December is the perfect time to do so. Find rooms and hotels that are quaint, pleasing in decor, abundant in comfort, suited to your pocket. Keep December Dainty, not Dirty 😉🎄.",
